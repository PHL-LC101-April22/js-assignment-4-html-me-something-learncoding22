         <p>After about three years of reflecting on my career journey and learning about different technologies, I’ve come to terms
         with the fact that I’m happiest when I’m involved in software development and creating accessibility &
         equity in education and resources. I now want to join an early-stage startup and leverage my unique & diverse background to lead the improvement & onboarding of products that drive positive social change.</p>
